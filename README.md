# Flutter Business Card App

Welcome to my Flutter Business Card App! ðŸš€

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Overview

This Flutter application serves as my introductory project while learning mobile app development. The app showcases a business card with dynamic and reusable UI components, following clean architecture principles.

## Features

- **Dynamic UI:** Built using Flutter's powerful widget system.
- **Clean Architecture:** Organized codebase for maintainability.
- **Reusable Components:** Modular design for easier extension.

## App Structure

The project is structured into different layers:

- **Presentation Layer:** Contains widgets responsible for the UI.
- **Domain Layer:** Holds the core business logic and entities.
- **Assets:** Images used in the app.

## Key Widgets

- `BusinessCardWidget`: Displays the main business card information.
- `CircleAvatarWidget`: Renders the circular avatar.
- `TitleCardWidget` and `JobTitleWidget`: Display the name and job title.
- `SeparatorWidget`: Provides a visual separation between sections.
- `LabelWidget`: Represents a labeled piece of information.

## Learning Points

- **Flutter vs. Kotlin:** Having previous experience with Kotlin, I've observed differences in language, UI frameworks, and the advantages of a single codebase in Flutter.
